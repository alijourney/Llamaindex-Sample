BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\n\nMobility\n\nOur Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more\u2014helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global leadership position\u2014and the vast amount of marketplace data that comes along with it\u2014means that we have the best technical and data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.\n\nWe believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce\u2014from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other retailers\u2014order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We launched our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over seven years ago, and the business now includes the applications Postmates, Drizly and Cornershop across different markets. We believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their own costs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13730, "end_char_idx": 16310, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65627473-8bde-400d-9c22-77a5c6506274": {"__data__": {"id_": "65627473-8bde-400d-9c22-77a5c6506274", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "8d79827bcdd2376c0910301a1d9045eed635a0b81173f91276c0fc04a518b8e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a32cf30c-a852-456b-98b5-db5717c349a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "d764d06d6ead86d214e1fe07127e5aeb30ea0f5a4a62a9fb372bca0e95595941", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f1fef0e-c31b-4ac2-ac89-8df93d5cad87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0134707bdf88018e3f52faf583573238d2464b94612b8786b059ceab8aeeeae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities.

For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across the network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries. Freight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks. Freight connects Carriers with Shippers\u2019 shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics solutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15229, "end_char_idx": 18018, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f1fef0e-c31b-4ac2-ac89-8df93d5cad87": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f1fef0e-c31b-4ac2-ac89-8df93d5cad87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "8d79827bcdd2376c0910301a1d9045eed635a0b81173f91276c0fc04a518b8e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "65627473-8bde-400d-9c22-77a5c6506274", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "73fd868137fa456df9728e46a2994f1fe71e2404757cce4cdaf936585cdcc791", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4982804-9a00-49aa-8b09-cf19bfcf58fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4cd9a2843983d62f9fac5b0503b2a6a4e12d8c696018f6071f96de80c902f34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries.

Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.\n\nMassive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers and Carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of December 31, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people. Leading Technology We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones. Operational Excellence Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators. Product Expertise Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.\n\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16872, "end_char_idx": 19733, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4982804-9a00-49aa-8b09-cf19bfcf58fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4982804-9a00-49aa-8b09-cf19bfcf58fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "8d79827bcdd2376c0910301a1d9045eed635a0b81173f91276c0fc04a518b8e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f1fef0e-c31b-4ac2-ac89-8df93d5cad87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "a758990480c8b2e68299f41a46dcdf035d40c7c0600ba5d12e7a26fbda2cfe7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "466c20e8-78b6-4562-a311-7f1f0a8923f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0e9c942da409a83da7b8bc5abeda6f414ff719c708f04899904fc789001e3fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Leading Technology We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies.

Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform-to-platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2022, over 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2022, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 10.9 Trips per month on average, compared to 4.6 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\n\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our \u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings.

During October 2022, we officially launched Uber\u2019s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process.

We also provide comprehensive reporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at relevant points throughout their journeys and transactions.

We believe that our advertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.\n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets.

As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\nDelivery.

Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through various channels. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and growth opportunities. For example, our hybrid return-to-office approach was shaped based on employee feedback.

Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business.

Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\n\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.

For example, since its launch in 2018, our partnership with Arizona State University has enrolled nearly 5,000 Drivers and their family members in undergraduate degree programs online.\n\nEngagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 45595, "end_char_idx": 48416, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb4297e5-fd71-43d5-94af-6ce692eb2afe": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb4297e5-fd71-43d5-94af-6ce692eb2afe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "8d79827bcdd2376c0910301a1d9045eed635a0b81173f91276c0fc04a518b8e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a80956b-b92c-4d2d-b990-ebeb6cd6dd9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2022}, "hash": "95f6a545dcb847e8742fe462ab6c662d426e1c0fcc318552bd990f6990994c15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "975d57c8-c31a-440a-8354-22f4265aea39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5bef5bd1f593f4d052dd5afe1083a455a94309beccc7e32fddd10d0d3d474dd4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers.\n\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\n\nLearning and Growth: We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible Drivers and their family members through undergraduate degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills development and language learning.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.

For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2022, we experienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to COVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance.

Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\n47\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n70\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.

Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The level of uncertainties and volatility related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.

In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\n\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less.

The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee.
