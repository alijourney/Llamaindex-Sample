Mobility also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, Transit and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDuring 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem Inc.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13507, "end_char_idx": 15936, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58208d6d-4bea-4bf3-b007-bf955424c976": {"__data__": {"id_": "58208d6d-4bea-4bf3-b007-bf955424c976", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "259b3d0c3509af69372e009ea7c75db91802472cb673f1effe6947528bac10b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3b2b847-3c01-4fde-93ea-bb9ca3f4cf17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "96ff1a9c0f63adf4bc0e762e05cc736ec6779df0cf3b2f7f5733cd69752f8a51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1b477f0-b015-4a20-9432-89f71fa29b58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51749c659be1066846027fe4c7ae98bf5d00cde87d5df3effa189ddf184195c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms.

We launched our Delivery app over five years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2020, we received regulatory approvals to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\"Cornershop\u201d\"), operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery.

For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. The Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit.

However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies from country to country, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although we do not expect that the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction will go into effect, litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees, including the California Attorney General\u2019s suit, remains pending, and we may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 309705, "end_char_idx": 312433, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d1274bb-d3fc-4d98-b641-4958cbc0beb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d1274bb-d3fc-4d98-b641-4958cbc0beb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "259b3d0c3509af69372e009ea7c75db91802472cb673f1effe6947528bac10b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb3e0807-515c-483d-affb-79435b852a48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "4b82453d7695da92193202931e4a066568062866c32511ef55205453a48b5654", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "46703c08-74e5-472a-8e98-6b7d8a411181", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e796982e8c4029d0212648c355d5eeff256057e44efbd7e6d3a190cc2ed83cc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although we do not expect that the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction will go into effect, litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees, including the California Attorney General\u2019s suit, remains pending, and we may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\n\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling.

Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result, prior period information presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the implementation of the new accounting policy.

We have concluded that we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we began charging end-users a fee for Mobility and Delivery services in certain markets. While our contracts and our previously disclosed accounting policy for Mobility Drivers and restaurants remains unchanged, in these markets we subcontract with Delivery People to provide delivery services to end-users. Revenue from restaurants, Mobility Drivers, and end-users is recognized separately, while costs associated with payments to Delivery People are recorded as cost of revenue.\n\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 327806, "end_char_idx": 330265, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4cf6b41-a2ca-4cbe-b34a-05d7d9ba1374": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4cf6b41-a2ca-4cbe-b34a-05d7d9ba1374", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "259b3d0c3509af69372e009ea7c75db91802472cb673f1effe6947528bac10b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b531a31f-0cf4-424e-bf82-007bc2337a1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "b047c7e8de3d797536f515c7370ef14eab06cc4faf52497bbf0df76b9104c4d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ae69dc9-62ca-4466-bb9e-3e1f5f211e2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3db2f0e4c64b6b041c92f344f30d95be931e12c547a240fdb0a3ca14c0107da8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "During the first quarter of 2020, we began charging end-users a fee for Mobility and Delivery services in certain markets.

$1.8 billion of our $5.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations.

We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of December 31, 2020, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 396248, "end_char_idx": 399081, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccc576bf-9149-4454-a5e3-c812cd121c4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccc576bf-9149-4454-a5e3-c812cd121c4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "259b3d0c3509af69372e009ea7c75db91802472cb673f1effe6947528bac10b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c1a0291-c32c-4804-aef5-f72fece5d9be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "23ccb6f2c88ba491b5bc08ae596c482a98eb42f598325b01ef4e3be190f3970d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "061cb9a3-673d-4e00-ab92-346e0fe36d82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72d545d51ff3627ba1abd1ed355981e621e0e60f738e958b0e8fd92c632d9ea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers.

These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.\n\nWe value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of these convertible notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 405078, "end_char_idx": 407876, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f06283f-7bd4-4851-a457-c5f717a84baa": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f06283f-7bd4-4851-a457-c5f717a84baa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "259b3d0c3509af69372e009ea7c75db91802472cb673f1effe6947528bac10b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e6ec2e2-2ed6-471e-bacf-894268d31a3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "cbdaf23b010e15cbece14f1a83592a2fbb5173a0ccb9c5ce55aed3e7ee232434", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e82606fa-0787-492e-9d25-1ca27c7d6112", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f401505ad4d20adf6f1529fad94df0b6de4dae10ee18df99cc2851b6e682c11a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cDelivery People\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nChange in Accounting Policy\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers. Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAs our business has evolved, we believe our new presentation policy is preferable as it better reflects the financial performance of transactions with customers across all of our businesses and provides more clarity about changes in both revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, resulting in improved financial reporting and alignment with financial information used internally by management.\n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, all periods presented below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effects of the change to revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. There was no net impact to loss from operations, net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., or net income (loss) per share for any periods presented.

If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements.

Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.

We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates.

The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique\n\nprimarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\n\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d) is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us.

Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.

Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was applied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services. As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by $230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million, representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 555055, "end_char_idx": 557579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac5a83c4-b789-4e91-976e-30e4a5271609": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac5a83c4-b789-4e91-976e-30e4a5271609", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "259b3d0c3509af69372e009ea7c75db91802472cb673f1effe6947528bac10b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7897149-0629-4f28-a850-9e311f21805e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "eee7d6746928da20e3c4db214137052e898391310c291051f6d82036786219d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b1acc78-d045-48c0-bf48-013be051e98d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "95b5db6c313e8dbfc98f7beacce75c08a92a6ebc46abe07b287e8cb71cca0f49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These observed inputs were considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities.

Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods, including the common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.\n\nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 based on the observable price in an orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (in millions):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Upward adjustments $ 1,984 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 Downward adjustments (including impairment) \u2014 \u2014 ( 1,690 ) Total unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities $ 1,984 $ \u2014 $ ( 1,690 )\n\nWe evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. This evaluation consists of several factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of a significant adverse change in the economic environment, significant adverse changes in the general market condition of the geographies and industries in which our investees operate, and other publicly available information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities.

As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from COVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was less than their carrying value.\n\n112\n\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM, weighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees\u2019 capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are considered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us. A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companies that have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations after consideration of impairments of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit. Also, during the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges to intangible assets of $23 million, property and equipment of $47 million and other current assets of $23 million in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in our New Mobility reporting unit.\n\nIn light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and demand for Mobility during 2020, we also considered whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our Mobility reporting unit was below its carrying value. Based on an analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors, including market valuation multiples of public companies operating in the same business and considering the significant excess of the fair value attributable to the Mobility reporting unit over its carrying value, we determined that Mobility goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe performed an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 581764, "end_char_idx": 584139, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "615ebcca-0b93-4954-bf5b-60c0fec1d5a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "615ebcca-0b93-4954-bf5b-60c0fec1d5a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "259b3d0c3509af69372e009ea7c75db91802472cb673f1effe6947528bac10b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "379d96f7-d2d6-46d5-84d4-2e37e6eff67c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"Year": 2020}, "hash": "4a9a0b0a00cd277fa18d2b9eebd8fa2d279b56e8e66ddc8b829564a252059227", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29c74519-e5ea-411b-8f97-eb7099f8efbd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8be1e1d66359cb072acf8256195ae6202e848e7816439a7bfc4777bae8712d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and demand for Mobility during 2020, we also considered whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our Mobility reporting unit was below its carrying value.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets.

Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc.

The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.

Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\n\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J.

Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded. In addition, we expect to be subject to related pension contributions, which will require separate engagement with the UK pension regulator, but the ultimate resolution of this matter, including the amount of any exposure is uncertain.\n\nOther Driver Classification Matters\n\nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees.

In July 2019, Google submitted its request for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and Google entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million.

Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement. In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. The indemnification dispute and Levandowski\u2019s claim will proceed in the bankruptcy court. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the trade secret conviction.
